            <p id="p1">
                I was born in Newport Beach, CA. I grew up in Irvine. My favorite things to do are snorkeling, goin to the beach in general,
                eating sushi and ramen, and playing video games. I went to college at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo and studied
                Food Science. I've done research and development in flavor chemistry and product development in snack foods.
                I was also a distiller for a distillery in Santa Barabara Country, making various whiskies and vodkas.

                I am now studying Web Development at the UCLA extension program with the intention of finding a job in this field. While
                I am initially studying web
                <em>development</em>, I would ideally like to focus on web
                <em>design</em>. No matter what I do, I want to be able to create. I have ideas for developing my own websites
                and apps. I would like to eventually combine my background in the food industry with these new tech skills
                in some form.
